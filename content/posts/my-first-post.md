When I did my first art it wasn't good because it needed more detail and colours so I started to practice. Here is one of my pictures when I was 9 it was a character from bloons tower defense called Gwendolin.

Next I made Obyn, a forest guardian. I used shading and thought it was really good it had good colours that I liked. So I modified it and made it look better here is a drawing of him.
