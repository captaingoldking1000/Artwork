Here is one of my pictures when I was 9 it was a character from bloons tower defense called Gwendolin.
Next I made Obyn, a forest guardian. I used shading and thought it was really good it had good colours that I liked. So I modified it and made it look better here is a drawing of him.</description></item><item><title>Owl</title><link>https://captaingoldking1000.github.io/Artwork/posts/owl/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jul 2020 10:27:47 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://captaingoldking1000.github.io/Artwork/posts/owl/</guid><description> I made a owl in year 2 in school I liked it very good (for me but probably not for you guys).
